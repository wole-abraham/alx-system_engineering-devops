# Exploring the Web Stack: What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com

When you type https://www.google.com into your browser's address bar and hit Enter, a complex series of events is triggered behind the scenes. Let's break down each step of this process to understand how the web stack works on top of the internet.

## DNS Request

The first step in the process is resolving the domain name www.google.com to an IP address. This is done through the Domain Name System (DNS). Your browser sends a DNS request to a DNS resolver, which then recursively queries other DNS servers until it finds the IP address associated with www.google.com.

## TCP/IP

Once the IP address is obtained, your browser establishes a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with the server hosting www.google.com using the obtained IP address. TCP ensures reliable communication by dividing data into packets and reassembling them at the destination.

## Firewall

Before the connection is established, it may pass through a firewall, which acts as a barrier between your computer and the internet, filtering out potentially malicious traffic based on predefined rules.

## HTTPS/SSL

If the website uses HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), as in the case of www.google.com, the browser initiates a secure connection using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security). This involves a cryptographic handshake where the server presents its SSL certificate to the browser, which verifies its authenticity. This ensures that the data exchanged between the browser and the server is encrypted and cannot be intercepted by third parties.

## Load Balancer

Behind the scenes, www.google.com is likely hosted on multiple servers distributed across different locations. A load balancer sits in front of these servers and distributes incoming requests across them to ensure optimal performance and reliability. This helps prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed with traffic.

## Web Server

Once the request reaches one of Google's servers, it is processed by a web server such as Apache or Nginx. The web server retrieves the requested web page or resource and sends it back to the browser over the established TCP connection.

## Application Server

In the case of dynamic content, such as search results on Google, the request may be forwarded to an application server. The application server executes the necessary code (e.g., Python, PHP, Java) to generate the requested content dynamically before sending it back to the web server for delivery to the browser.

## Database

If the requested content relies on data stored in a database, such as user preferences or search indexes, the application server may query the database to retrieve the required information. The database server then processes the query and returns the results to the application server, which incorporates them into the final response sent back to the browser.

In conclusion, typing https://www.google.com into your browser triggers a complex chain of events involving DNS resolution, TCP/IP communication, security measures like HTTPS/SSL, load balancing for scalability, web servers for content delivery, application servers for dynamic content generation, and databases for data retrieval. Understanding this process is crucial for software engineers working on web applications and services.
